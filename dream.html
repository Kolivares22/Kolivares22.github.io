	<h1>Dream Vacation</h1>
	<hr id="vac" width="500"/>
<p class="dream">My dream vacation is something I never thought of, but somehow have it kind of made up in my head already. It would forsure take place in Europe because it's a place that I've been wanting to visit for a long time. The overall trip would take at least a month, no less than that. The countries that pop into my head about visiting right now would be England, Spain, France, and Italy. The things that I would do would consist of shopping, visiting art museums and hidden gems within the country. It would be a dream to travel to the other countries by train. </p>
