<p id="page">	The reason why I chose Antigua as my topic is because of my family connection to Guatemala.
	My parents are both from Guatemala and we recently traveled to Antigua for the first time during spring break and we were blown away by it's beauty. My mother always wanted to visit and show us the unique culture outside of their home town that we usually only visit when we come to Guatemala. Visiting that place felt as if we were visiting a different country and you can clearly see the Spanish influence within the city.</p>
	<center><p id="make"> Making this website page helped me learn even more about Antigua that I have yet discovered. We only visited the city for a few days, so we weren't able to do much. Maybe in the future my family and I will plan even more things to do when we visit again.</p></center>
